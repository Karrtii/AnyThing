# AnyThing
AnyThing is a text based android app where you can do... anything! You want to create an epic high-fantasy movie story? Sure! You want to create a game where you are not bound by any rules, choices, or genres? Absolutely! Anything goes. Just create a server where your new adventure will be writte, but the catch is that anybody can pop in play along with you. Imagining a horror game where you are avoiding detection of a hostile enemy? POP! Suddenly there's player 2, or that might be an enemy. The story can be whatever you want it to be. The only limitation is your imagination
